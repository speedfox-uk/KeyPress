#Aruduino USB HID Key event library Library#

This library allows a USB capable Arduino to act as a USB keyboard. Unlike the standard keyboard library included with the Arduino software this library removes the mapping of ASCII characters to USB HID scan codes and allows control of the keyboard via scan codes directly.  

Heavily based off the standard Arduino Keyboard library (https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Keyboard)
